# Non-Cartesian GRAPPA

This work has been submitted to MRM.

setup_NonCrtGRAPPA.m does configurations.

Navigate to './GRAPPA/test' for running test file grappaTestScript.m

The algorithm is implemented as stand-alone, no dependency is required.

However, [MIRT](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/irt/fessler.tgz) box is needed for running grappaTestScript.m
